        <h4 class="px-5">Hello everybody!</h4>
        <p class="px-5">The day when I harvested a bagful of Tomatoes from my beautiful little plant, I came to know how
            blissful it
            feels. And it tastes even more yummy than the one we got from the markets. (Little story about I started)
            We all need time away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life to get lost in nature; after all, who
            doesn't like to be alone for a while in a peaceful environment? So won't you read why we started and how it
            all right now!?
        </p>

        <div class="d-flex justify-content-around py-5">
            <img src="images/6.jpg" class="article-image">
            <img src="images/4.jpg" class="article-image">

        </div>

        <p class="px-5">It was around March 2021, or may be April 2021, when I happened to see a video about “Yogic
            Kheti” on
            Youtube. Yogic farming refers to carrying out various farming activities in a yoga state or mentally
            empowered state. It is a unique style of farming that integrates thought-based meditation techniques with
            organic farming practices. And we were also free at home because it was close to a lockdown, and we reduced
            buying vegetables from the market because we were worried about being caught by Corona. And most of my time
            then was spent watching these videos online. And it all began with the planting of a few vegetable plants in
            our front yard. We employ various methods, including watching YouTube videos on how to get more seeds.</p>

        <div class="d-flex  justify-content-center">
            <img src="images/3.jpg" class="article-header-image py-5  ">
        </div>
        <p class="px-5">
            And, one by one, more plants are joining the previous ones in our garden. And this was around October 2021,
            when I had nearly 25 or 30 plant pots in my front yard. And here, we brought every pot to the terrace.
            <br><br>
            Following that, I decided that I wanted an area where my lovely plants could grow in a suitable environment.
            (I'm referring to Kyaari, as it is known in Hindi)
            And have the contractors build it for that purpose. The cemented Kyari is about 22 feet in length, 1.5 feet
            deep and about 2 feet in width. Also, it has holes so that excess water can easily flow out from it. So, now
            our terrace garden looks like this…

            <img src="images/6.jpg" class="article-image">
            <img src="images/4.jpg" class="article-image">

        </div>

        <p class="px-5">Now that winter has arrived, we have sown seeds of vegetables such as tomato, carrot, lettuce,
            radish, turnip, brinjal, and others.
            They started bringing us nutritious fruits and vegetables, and we gradually added more plants until my
            terrace resembled this.


            This is how my garden looks.

        <p class="pt-5">
            We received so many tomatoes last year that we gave them to our neighbours; I remember taking our own grown
            tomatoes to our relatives' house. And one of the reasons I enjoy gardening is that I now have some time,
            fresh air, and a positive environment where I can meditate. And in the morning, so many birds and
            butterflies come into our garden. I enjoy reading books and finding peace by sitting outside and listening
            to birds chirp. And the best part about growing and maintaining our own garden is that we can get it
            whenever we need it. Like how amazing it feels to use something on which we have spent our time and effort,
            as if it is priceless. Isn't that incredible in and of itself? And I truly appreciate that I began
            maintaining this which definitely makes me even more happy. I genuinely enjoy going there by myself.
